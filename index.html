        <h2 style="text-align: center;">I opted for a more interactive take on the web design portion by extending my base page to act like a Windows 98 environment.</h2>
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_98">
            <img src="img/win98.png" width="346" height="275" style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; display: block;"/>

        <p>Since my interests lie with various aspects of computers, I figured it would be a neat challenge to try and create a web presence that mimics that of a more classical windows environment.
        This is half because I was having troubles thinking of another topic to build a site on, and half because I really wanted to see the
        reactions of those who once had to deal with such a fine operating system.</p>
        <p>Before you ask why, I would counter with why not? Who doesn't want a taste of the nostalgic horror that is the default teal background, and off white windows. Bringing back that feeling of
        having to be told when it is safe to shut down <i>(Go ahead try it)</i> your computer was the goal of this project</p>
        <h3 style="text-align:center;">I hope you enjoy this little blast from the past, who knows maybe I'll extend it more in the future!</h3>

        <h1 class="window-week-title">Week 3 Project</h1>
        <h2 style="text-align: center; color:grey;">All images can be opened for better viewing if desired.</h2>
        <h2 style="text-align: center;">Part 1 - Thresholding</h2>
        <a href="img/week-3/oreo.png">
            <img src="img/week-3/oreo.png" style="max-width: 100%; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; display: block;"/>
        </a>
        <p style="padding:1em; text-align: center;">
        The first image has a subjective "best" threshold value depending on what features of Oreo we want to focus on. I ended up landing on a value of <b>85</b> to produce this image that
        accentuates Oreo's features. The alternative is we could have adjusted the threshold value so the lighter parts of Oreo and the window were more discernible, but again that is subject to the viewers liking.</p>
        <a href="img/week-3/image.gif">
            <img src="img/week-3/image.gif" style="max-width: 100%; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; display: block;"/>
        </a>
        <p style="padding:1em; text-align: center;">Unlike the first image, this seemingly black box has a very objective best threshold value (unless your goal is to ignore the information in the picture) and that value is <b>1</b>. Why? Because
        for any other value the text is not visible. </p>

        <h2 style="text-align: center;">Part 2 - Thresholding</h2>
        <a href="img/week-3/barbotan-115.jpg">
            <img src="img/week-3/barbotan-115.jpg" style="max-width: 100%; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; display: block;"/>
        </a>
        <p style="padding:1em; text-align: center;">This thresholded image is the result of applying a threshold value of 115 to the image. I chose this value because it offers a balance of clarity, and removal of the background. I would
        argue that there is no single "best" threshold value, as applying more of a threshold value would result in the text starting to disappear, becoming harder to read, and applying less would
        make the background (folds in the paper) more visible. There's a trade off between clarity and quality that is subject to the viewers liking.</p>

        <h2 style="text-align: center;">Part 3 - Color Intensity</h2>
        <a href="img/week-3/Boxes-color.png">
            <img src="img/week-3/Boxes-color.png" style="max-width: 100%; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; display: block;"/>
        </a>
        <a href="img/week-3/Boxes-grey.png">
            <img src="img/week-3/Boxes-grey.png" style="max-width: 100%; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; display: block;"/>
        </a>
        <p style="padding:1em; text-align: center;">The above image was constructed by picking colors with the same intensity/lightness value. The image below is after applying a Image > Mode > Greyscale in photoshop. As we can see, because of the similar light
        intensity values, when converted to grey values the circles disappear as the colors are treated as the same.</p>

        <h2 style="text-align: center;">Part 4 - Sharpening</h2>
        <a href="img/week-3/sheet_music.jpg">
            <img src="img/week-3/sheet_music.jpg" style="width: 47%; text-align: center; padding:1% ;margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; display: inline-block;"/>
        </a>
        <a href="img/week-3/sheet_music-extra-sharpened.jpg">
            <img src="img/week-3/sheet_music-sharpened.jpg" style="width: 47%; padding:1%; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; display: inline-block;"/>
        </a>
        <p style="padding:1em; text-align: center;">I included 2 images above so it is easier to contrast the difference that sharpening the image makes. The first is the original, the second is after doing a smart sharpen on the image.
        What we can see vs. the original is that the discolored pixels
        as a result of the jpg encoding become less apparent, and the white space between the bars on the sheet music become clearer, as well as the lines becoming darker and more defined. But with more and more passes with start to lose
        quality, as the black pixels from the bars on the sheet music start to disappear, and imperfections on the sheet start to show more, resulting in a spotty image and lower image quality overall.</p>

        <h2 style="text-align: center; font-size: 2em;">The net art piece I have designed is a website that allows users from around the world to draw their perspective of a word that is scraped from the Urban Dictionary.</h2>
        
        <h3 style="text-align: center; color: grey; font-size: 0.7em;">"Sketches" were done in Photoshop as my freehand skills are very poor</h3>
        
        <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 2em;">This will be done by scraping the newest trending words each day from <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com">https://www.urbandictionary.com</a> using a Python bot and storing them into a database
        along with their accompanying definition after repeats and date oriented definitions are removed. This is due to the fact that after investigation of the trending words there's usually multiple "October 10" definitions
        in the trending page.</p>
        <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 2em;">When a user enters the page they will be greeted by a blank page with the ability to "enter" the game, at this point their location (via IP or browser location statistics) is gathered.</p>

        <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 2em;">After clicking the Draw button the system then grabs one of the words scraped from the Urban Dictionary and asks them to draw it preferably allowing two input methods, 
        either the user can draw it with their mouse or upload a hand drawn image from their computer.</p>

        <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 2em;"> If the user instead selects an image to guess instead they are brought to the guess screen where they are presented with the location of the artist, the artists success rating, and the image itself.</p>

        <h2 style="text-align: center; color:grey;">All images can be opened for better viewing if desired.</h2>
        <h2 style="text-align: center;">Rough Sketches</h2>
        <a href="img/week-5/sketch-bad.png">
            <img src="img/week-5/sketch-bad.png" style="max-width: 100%; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; display: block;"/>
        </a>
        <p style="padding:1em; text-align: center;">
        The sketch presented above was my first idea for the explosion animation, but when actually trying to implement this design I realized not only would it be very difficult given my little to no ability in drawing/animation, it also didn't have
        a source for the explosion. Realizing this, I came up with a simpler, more clear animation that featured a bomb exploding, as you can see in the second sketch below.</p>
        <a href="img/week-5/sketch-good.png">
            <img src="img/week-5/sketch-good.png" style="max-width: 100%; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; display: block;"/>
        </a>
        <p style="padding:1em; text-align: center;">This second design would be much easier to implement from a non-artist standpoint, allowing the use of simple shapes and frame-by-frame animation to implement for a non-professional. It features the
        black bomb with a fuse that runs down over the first few frames, then explodes outwards from the middle of the bomb with some extra screen shake to try and simulate the "force" of the explosion. The sketch shows 6 frames, however the finished
        animation is actually made up of 17 different frames.</p>

        <h2 style="text-align: center;">Animation</h2>
        <a href="img/week-5/bomb.gif">
            <img src="img/week-5/bomb.gif" style="max-width: 100%; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; display: block;"/>
        </a>
        <p style="padding:1em; text-align: center;">Here is the finished 17 frame animation, each frame exists on the screen for 75.0 milliseconds, resulting in an animation length of 1.275 seconds. I chose this number because it not only makes
        the animation appear a bit smoother, but also hides some of the imperfections in the later frames.</p>

       </div>
        <p style="padding:1em; text-align: center;">Here we can see each frame by itself, showing how I made the explosion animation by creating each frame as a separate PSD then combining them all in a different program. Photoshop has the ability to make
        an animation by using each layer as a frame, however this goes against how I would usually use photoshop layers to distinguish between objects, so I went with this route. Each of the frames consists of roughly 4 objects/layers: The bomb, 
      The outer explosion, The inner explosion, and depending on the frame either the fuse, or the white space inside the explosion.</p>

        <h1 style="text-align: center; font-size:2em;">Gravity Bone</h1>
        <h2>Questions</h2>
        <h4>1) How does the allowed interaction keep the narrative on track? How does it permit variations and branches?</h4>
        <p>It keeps the story and narrative simple and easy to follow by not allowing too many unnecessary actions to take from the story the player is meant to follow.
        During the time I spent playing the game I went out of my way to try and interact with other elements of the environemnt (people, doors, sinks, etc.) but none seemed to do anything
        besides the objects you are meant to interact with from a story perspective.Because of this Gravity Bone appears less like a game to me, and more like a story that the player is meant 
        to follow, not allowing them to make their own choices and instead following the set path the developer intended them to follow.</p>
        <h4>2) Describe the nature of the graphical quality and how it is relevant to the story.</h4>
        <p>The artistic style and graphical quality of the game was cute and lighthearted, pointing me to more of a blocky minecraft feel. To my surprise it was actually made on the same engine
        as Quake II, a game with a far darker atmosphere and less cheery vibe. The way they chose to present the story from a graphical standpoint was definitely humorous, the missions you received
        appeared almost comical in the way they are given, however the change from level 1 to level 2 was an important one I believe the developers intended to engage the player with. Whereas the first level
        is bright, cheery, and in a party atmosphere, the second level is dark, provides real consequence for bad gameplay (multiple ways to fail) and this darker atmosphere really helps build up to the conclusion
        of the player being shot at the end of the level.</p>
        <h4>3) Describe the nature of the interaction and how it influences choices and how the player feels. </h4>
        <p>The restriction of the players ability to interact with the environment leaves very few choices that the player has to make themselves. This linear playstyle, as stated before points me to
        considering Gravity Bone as less of a game, and more of a story presented in a 3D world. The choices the player makes are those the developer forces the player to make in order to progress further in the 
        story, so instead of an RPG like game where the player has a part in creating the story, it's more as if the player is watching the story unfold - similar to a movie.</p>
        <br>
        <div style="display:inline-block; text-align:left;">
            <h2>A Description of My Gameplay</h2>
            <h3>(Since I found the game to be entirely linear, I will simply provide a linear description of the events as they unfolded.)</h3>
            <h4>First Mission</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>I came down an elevator to cheery music, I'm at a masquerade party.</li>
                <li>I stepped out of the elevator and saw a memo card in my hand telling me to find a furnace room.</li>
                <li>I tried to interact ('e') with some people at the party, no results.</li>
                <li>I wondered if you could jump off the edge, you can, and you die.</li>
                <li>I walked around the walkway and up some stairs, found a door that says "staff only" but it doesn't open</li>
                <li>Found out I can get through the door when a waiter opens it</li>
                <li>The furnace room is back here! There's a sign telling me how to jump</li>
                <li>Assuming the game telling me how to jump was a hint, I jumped on the sink, furnace, then went behind it.</li>
                <li>Behind the furnace was a briefcase, it gave me a mission to give a drink to a man with red hair, as well as the drink in question and a waiter suit</li>
                <li>I left the room and went upstairs, the only place I had not been yet.</li>
                <li>The man with the red hair was upstairs, so I gave him the drink - nice burp.</li>
                <li>It seems my job here is done, and I'm told to exit, so I head back to the door beside the first elevator and exit the level.</li>
                <li>I guess giving him the drink made him extra smelly and trackable across the galaxy, neat.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Second Mission</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>This time I came up an elevator, it's dark, rainy, and gloomy out. I seems like I'm in an office tower of sorts.</li>
                <li>Once again I have a note to go to the furnace room.</li>
                <li>Tried all the doors around me, none seemed to open, although the furnace room is much easier to find this time.</li>
                <li>There seems to be some slamming traps of death in the furnace room, I'm not sure what functional purpose they serve but they look lethal.</li>
                <li>They are in fact lethal. Thanks for the quake death sounds.</li>
                <li>Respawned and went back to the furnace room, this time going through the slammy traps without dying.</li>
                <li>On the other side was a hammer, and a can of sprayable freon?</li>
                <li>Doesn't look like I can go back the way I came, but the door in front of me has a padlock on it.</li>
                <li>Breaking it with the hammer doesn't work.</li>
                <li>However spraying it with freon first does the trick!</li>
                <li>After breaking two locks I found another briefcase</li>
                <li>I guess I have to take pictures of... birds?</li>
                <li>I exited the furnace room through the only way I hadn't been yet</li>
                <li>Door to the right is locked, where are the birds?</li>
                <li>Started looking out windows for birds</li>
                <li>Noticed a walkway leading to a red door, went that way</li>
                <li>Opened the door to find a bird inside!</li>
                <li>Took a picture of the bird with the camera... it exploded?</li>
                <li>I went back across the walkway, noticed two red doors I had missed initially</li>
                <li>Both had photograph-volatile birds in them that also exploded when being photographed</li>
                <li>Now where to find the final two?</li>
                <li>Outside looks like there's a jump puzzle. I hate jump puzzles</li>
                <li>I really searched for an alternative to the jump puzzle... But there's red doors at the end of it</li>
                <li>Finally realized I guess I have to commit to the jump puzzle</li>
                <li>Thankfully this seemingly small flagpoles have a collider about 100 times their visual size.</li>
                <li>Surprisingly made it across the jump puzzle in one go!</li>
                <li>Queue photographing volatile birds - note that trying to stand in the explosion does not harm the self.</li>
                <li>Went through the door at the end of the walkway, I appear to be just behind the door I tried to get through earlier.</li>
                <li>Climbed through the vent which appeared to be my only option, which put me back in the furnace room with the slammy death trap.</li>
                <li>I went back to the elevator to exit</li>
                <li>And was shot in the back</li>
                <li>The shooter took my camera and ran off through the window, at this point I figured that was it</li>
                <li>Turns out I am remarkably resilient and could chase after her, oops. I'm a little behind now</li>
                <li>I chased her through a long section of walkways, railroad tracks, buildings, etc. (In similar fashion to Quake II series games, you move faster when running diagonally ;))</li>
                <li>I turn a hard corner and am shot again, this time multiple times. I break the guard railing behind me and fall from the walkway.</li>
                <li>As I'm falling it appears as though I'm going through flashbacks of notable events in my life. I'm assuming I was meant to die and this is actually the end for my character</li>
                <li>The screen goes black, and it's the end of the game.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
         <p>I know nothing else is required past here but this was actually a really interesting assignment, I've never truly thought of breaking down a game into its individual choices like this, it makes 
         the developers thinking strategy much more clear to me as a player, and the game itself was a hoot and a wonderful throwback to simpler times!</p>

        <h2 style="text-align: center;">Instructions</h2>

        <h3 style="text-align: center;">Controls</h3>
        <h4 style="text-align: center;">Movement: W-A-S-D or Arrow Keys</h4>
        <h4 style="text-align: center;">Interact: "e"</h4>
        <p style="text-align: center">
            The game is split into 2 separate "problems", an explanation on how to complete both is below, along with a few skips that I implemented to make testing/presenting easier.
            <br>
        </p>
        <h3 style="text-align: center;">Problem 1</h3>
        <p style="max-width: 50%; margin-left:25%;">
            Problem 1 is more difficult than the rest of the game and requires some knowledge of javascript, or at least the ability to manipulate variables in the web console. To solve
            this problem the player must open the web console after starting the game, and change the 'dimensions' variable to 2. Initially the hints I gave in the games interface were much more
            vague but after discovering nobody could solve this problem I made them a lot more obvious.
        </p>
        <h3 style="text-align: center;">Problem 2</h3>
        <p style="max-width: 50%; margin-left:25%;">
            Problem 2 is a set of 3 separate problems (to unlock the X-Y-Z plane) that are in the directions left, up, and right. To the bottom is the end of the game, which will be unlockable after
            completing all 3 challenges.
        </p>
        <h4 style="text-align: center;">Problem 2 - Left</h3>
        <p style="max-width: 50%; margin-left:25%;">
            The left problem is a simple problem of addition, the figure asks you to take the sum of two, by that it is expected that the user would talk to the figure twice, noting the number of hums
            each time, adding them together, then typing that number into their keyboard. There is no input box, the game simply checks for the sequence being correct.
        </p>
        <h4 style="text-align: center;">Problem 2 - Up</h3>
            <p style="max-width: 50%; margin-left:25%;">
                The problem on the top end of the screen is a Simon Says/DDR clone, requiring the user to use their arrow keys to follow the pattern the computer randomly generates. This has to be completed
                3 times, each time a little more difficult than the last.
            </p>

        <h4 style="text-align: center;">Problem 2 - Right</h3>
            <p style="max-width: 50%; margin-left:25%;">
                The most straight forward of all the problems, it's simply a maze that the player must navigate, and upon reaching the end, interact with the pad to complete the challenge.
            </p>

        <h4 style="text-align: center;">Cheats/Skips</h4>
        <p style="max-width: 50%; margin-left:25%;">
            For the ease of presenting/testing I implemented two skips/cheats.
            During problem 1 you can press "End" at any point on the keyboard to skip to problem 2.
            During problem 2 pressing "Insert" automatically completes the DDR (top) problem.
